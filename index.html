          <p class="about__paragraph">
            I first caught coding vibes in 2001 when I was 11 years old and my
            brother brought over a copy of the original Fallout game for PC. For
            a few months I was addicted to fighting radscorpions and raiders,
            relying on my trusty Pip-boy for survival. He took the game back to
            his mother's eventually but I had gained an affinity for Courier New
            and green text on a dark gray background. A few years later I was
            introduced to Gaia Online by my school friends, an anime themed
            online web forum where I exercised my creative writing skills by
            participating in and creating text-based roleplaying games. It was
            there that I memorized BB Code and felt the satisfaction of
            formatting beautiful posts by simply framing my text with code.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            It was also the days of myspace and sometimes I browsed all the
            profile templates created by other people, wondering how they did
            that. I looked at the code and it was almost readable, but not
            readable enough for me to consider that I would be able to do
            something like that.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            Those days ended, years passed, and I worked towards going into a
            helping and healing profession, working between administrative,
            customer service and therapy aide roles until I eventually became a
            Licensed Massage Therapist in 2018. I didn't give coding much more
            thought until COVID hit in 2020 and I started trying to think of
            ways to distance myself from the close contact with clients that was
            necessary for my profession. I looked into free Harvard courses
            during that time-one of them being CS50-but I had many other things
            to figure out before I could focus on anything new.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            By 2023, I reached a point in my life where I felt that I could no
            longer sustain the level of care that I provided to others while
            maintaining my own health and wellness at the same time. I searched
            for a change and I remembered the old days I spent on webforums,
            playing Fallout, and forgetting about the real world.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            I knew learning to code would be a challenge because it would be a
            radical change to the skillset that I had cultivated for over 10
            years, but I was ready for a lifestyle in which I could focus on
            myself and my family rather than draining myself trying to heal the
            whole world. A remote position as a web developer answers that need.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            When I'm not at my desk, I'm usually outside in nature, with my
            family, obsessing over plants or snuggling with my animals.
